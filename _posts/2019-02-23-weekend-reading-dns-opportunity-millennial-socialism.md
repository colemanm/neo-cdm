### 🔌 [Announcing 1.1.1.1: Privacy-First DNS](https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-1111/ "Announcing 1.1.1.1: Privacy-First DNS")

This is an old announcement, but new to me. CloudFlare now hosts privacy-centric DNS at [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1/ "1.1.1.1"), available to all:

> We talked to the APNIC team about how we wanted to create a privacy-first, extremely fast DNS system. They thought it was a laudable goal. We offered Cloudflare's network to receive and study the garbage traffic in exchange for being able to offer a DNS resolver on the memorable IPs. And, with that, 1.1.1.1 was born.

### 🛰 [Opportunity is No More](https://twitter.com/jacobmargolis/status/1095436908899913729?s=12 "Opportunity is No More")

The Mars rover Opportunity is now out of commission. This Twitter thread from Jacob Margolis goes through a timeline of what happened to the rover. It first landed and began exploring the Martian surface in 2004. The system exceeeded its intended planned operational lifespan by "14 years and 46 days". An incredible feat of engineering.

### 🏛 [Millennial Socialism](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/02/14/millennial-socialism "Millenial Socialism")

I don't post much about politics here, preferring to keep most of that to myself. I did find this piece an interesting perspective on the rise of a particular flavor of socialist-oriented ideology, and the too-common notion that so much should be guided, directed, or outright owned by government. On the risk of regulatory capture vs the value of the market:

> Bureaucracy at any level provides opportunities for special interests to capture influence. The purest delegation of power is to individuals in a free market.
