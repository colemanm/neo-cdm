Today we got to see the touring production of _Hamilton_ in Tampa. It's every bit as good as the hype.

I'm a history nerd already, so the subject matter is right up my alley. I read the book a couple of years ago and enjoyed it tremendously. I hope that the level this has reached in popular culture has increased peoples' interest and respect for American history.
