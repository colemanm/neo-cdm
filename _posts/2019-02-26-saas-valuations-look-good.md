Some [interesting data](https://medium.com/@sammyabdullah/saas-valuations-look-good-71d7c57b9a0f "SaaS valuations look good") on the current state of public SaaS company performance:

> SaaS multiples look steady: of the 82 SaaS companies we follow, the average public SaaS business is trading at 10.03x revenue while the median is 7.72x. Interestingly, the gap between the average and median has never been larger for the time period shown, meaning more attractive SaaS companies are being rewarded with big premiums.

While valuations aren't everything when it comes to company health (the calculus for valuation can change quickly), [recurring revenue]({{ site.url }}/post/power-of-saas-models/ "Power of SaaS Models") is still an amazing thing if you build a company with attractive unit economics. Predictability is highly valued!
